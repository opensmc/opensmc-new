    <h2>Hack SMC</h2>
    <h4>May 21, 2016</h4>
    <p>The Hack SMC is a day-long event where individuals and groups come together to design and create a software application or concept that addresses a need in San Mateo County. Entrants utilize the County’s Open Data Portal to create apps, websites, etc. that help streamline County service delivery, increase collaboration between County officials and residents, and reduce some employee tasks and assignments that will allow for staff time to be redirected to duties that are more complex or of higher value.

    <h2>#Hack4Congress</h2>
    <h4>March 2015</h4>

    <p>#Hack4Congress events bring together designers, journalists, Congressional staffers, policy wonks, technologists, academics, and other experts for two days of intense collaboration. Our goal: to find creative ways Congress can become more effective, efficient, and open. Solutions can be policy changes, technology tools, or other innovations.</p>
    <p>Participants form teams around specific challenges. After two days of problem-solving, groups present their work to a panel of judges. The winning team from each event will share their work with members of Congress and their staffers in May.</p>
