Tonight's hacknight was the core team working steady on our projects.

Service Locator demonstrated a csv to geojson tool importing school location data.  They worked on adding layers to the maps.

CycleSMC is working on getting the back end openshift implementation running.  The question is reuse Code for Philly's api code or rewrite into some other API framework?  The API is only 4 end points.

The Urban Agriculture project is learning that building codes are complex and confusing.

Lots of improvements on the web site.  A big thank you team.

We are looking forward to our next hacknight next week.

There are two upcoming social hacking events:

 * [Code for America's (Inter)National Day of Civic Hacking, June 4th.]  
(http://hack-smc.org/)
 * [OpenSMC will host a hack day in Redwood City.]  Details will follow.

Thank you OpenGov for hosting OpenSMC in a great hack space.
