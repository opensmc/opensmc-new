Last night was OpenSMC's fourth hacknight.  Our last at the County Center.  Thank you County of San Mateo for the meeting space.

OpenGov has graciously offered OpenSMC a beautiful meeting space starting with our next hacknight, Feb 2ed.  Heads up folks OpenGov is at 955 Charter Street, Redwood City.  Charter Street is just south of Woodside Rd (Hwy 84) between Broadway and Bay Streets.

A great turn out tonight.  Over A dozen people.  Most of us are regulars with a third new people.  New people are always welcome.

The two major projects were SMC Service Finder and the OpenSMC logo.

The Service Finder team is learning how to use and troubleshoot their JavaScript/Cordova development tools.

Web team turned on the OpenSMC web site.  A Jekyll based web site hosted on github pages.

Jessica Parsons gave a short discussion on using markdown in OpenSMC web pages.

The leadership team worked start-up issues: email, slack membership and general scheduling.

We are looking forward to our next hacknight next week.
