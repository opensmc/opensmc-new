# OpenSMC's changes in year 3

OpenSMC's [Hack Night](http://www.meetup.com/OpenSMC/) has been ongoing for two years this June. We started as a monthly speaker and ideation series in June 2015 and have gone on to launch projects like the [Brigade's website](http://opensmc.org/), [Flu Clinic Finder App](https://github.com/opensmc/smcfluclinics), and the [3B's map](http://www.sustainablesanmateo.org/home/sustainability-resources/3bs/) in collaboration with Sustainable San Mateo County. Hack night became a weekly event in January 2016\. We had the good fortune to have [OpenGov](https://www.opengov.com) as an in-kind sponsor who provided meeting space each Tuesday night, even on Tuesday, November 8 when OpenGov's co-founder and CEO told us we were hardcore for hacking while the election returns were coming in.

Over the past few months, we've done some great work on projects like [Park Periscope](https://github.com/opensmc/park-periscope) and [Get Connected SMC](https://github.com/opensmc/get-connected-smc) but we've struggled maintain high levels of attendance at hack night. It's time we reevaluate hack night and OpenSMC as a Brigade.

We're taking the next three hack nights (June 13, 20, and 27) to strategize about how we can change direction as a Bridage to continue to solve community issues with technology sustainably. If you're interested in owning a [project on the list](http://opensmc.org/projects/) or have ideas about what you'd like to see OpenSMC do in the future, we would love to have you join us, even if you haven't attended hack night before.

After June 27, OpenSMC's weekly hack nights will be on hiatus but we will maintain our website, Slack channels, and services in order to promote remote participation.

We're also looking for anyone interested in taking on a leadership role in OpenSMC. Please contact [John Ridener](mailto:jridener@opensmc.org) if you're interested in helping with OpenSMC.
