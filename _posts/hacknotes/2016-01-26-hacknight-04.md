Last night was OpenSMC's fourth hack night.  Our last at the County Center.  Thank you County of San Mateo for the meeting space.

OpenGov has graciously offered OpenSMC a beautiful meeting space starting with our next hacknight, Feb 2nd.  Heads up, folks: OpenGov is at 955 Charter Street, Redwood City.  Charter Street is just south of Woodside Rd (Hwy 84) between Broadway and Bay Streets.

A great turn out tonight.  Over A dozen people.  Most of us are regulars with a third new people.  New people are always welcome.

The two major projects were SMC Service Finder and the OpenSMC logo.

We are looking forward to our next hack night next week.
