Tonight was OpenSMC's third hack night.

OpenGov has graciously offered OpenSMC a beautiful meeting space starting with our Feb 2nd hack night.

OpenSMC is co-sponsoring two upcoming Hackday events:

* Code Across - March 5th, Open Data Day
* San Mateo County's HackSMC2 - May 21st

Exact locations and times TBA.

A lot of interesting progress was made on our projects:

* The Flu clinic mobile app team worked at setting up their Cordova development environment to build the apps.

* Web team turned on the OpenSMC web site.  A Jekyll based web site hosted on github pages.

* Jessica Parsons gave a short discussion on using markdown in OpenSMC web pages.

* The leadership team worked start-up issues: email, slack membership and general scheduling.

We are looking forward to our next hack night next week.
