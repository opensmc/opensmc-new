Tonight's hack night was the core team working steady on our projects.

The Service Locator group demonstrated a csv-to-geojson tool importing school location data.  They worked on adding layers to the maps.

The CycleSMC group is working on getting the back-end OpenShift implementation running.  The question is whether to reuse Code for Philly's API code or rewrite into some other API framework?  The API is only 4 end points.

The Urban Agriculture project is learning that building codes are complex and confusing.

Lots of improvements on the web site.  A big thank you team.

We are looking forward to our next hack night next week.

There are two upcoming social hacking events:

* San Mateo County's [HackSMC](http://hack-smc.org/), May 21st
* Code for America's [(Inter)National Day of Civic Hacking](https://www.codeforamerica.org/events/national-day-2016), June 4th

Thank you OpenGov for hosting OpenSMC in a great hack space.
