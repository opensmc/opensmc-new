    <h1>About OpenSMC</h1>
    <p>OpenSMC is a group of people, first and foremost. We also call ourselves technologists, planners, designers, doers, thinkers, and activists. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/opensmc/">Each month</a>, we meet to talk about our projects and learn about opportunities and needs in the community. Between meetups, we collaborate remotely to improve the County of San Mateo, often <a href="https://github.com/opensmc">using technology</a> to support our efforts. By connecting people, organizations, resources, tools, and networks to build for San Mateo County, we will all thrive.</p>

    <h2>Brigade</h2>
    <p>OpenSMC is a local chapter of the Code for America Brigade, an international network of people committed to using their voices and hands, in collaboration with local governments, to make their cities better.</p>

    <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
    <p>OpenSMC holds its leadership and participants to a Code of Conduct, which applies to our meetups, events, and digital forums. Please read our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FqPOP-QVWQ1-vW7XYeL9A6liE0VSLOXRh2KqCUKAE00">Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>OpenSMC is a safe space for experimentation, learning and
      practicing skills, taking chances, and asking questions, all to effect and encourage positive change. Whenever possible, we proactively reach out to those who are left out, excluded, ignored, or discriminated against. Those people, in our opinion, represent our most desirable source for experiences, knowledge, and thoughts. We fail without their involvement.
